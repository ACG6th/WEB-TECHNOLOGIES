		<h2>Health tips and diets</h2> 
		<p style="font-size: 18px;"> Starchy carbohydrates should make up just over a third of the food you eat. <span style="color: var(--red)">They include potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and cereals.</span>
Choose <span style="color: var(--red)">higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their skins on.</span>
They contain more fibre than white or refined starchy carbohydrates and can help you feel full for longer.
Try to include <span style="color: var(--red)">at least 1 starchy food with each main meal.</span> Some people think starchy foods are fattening, but gram for gram the carbohydrate they contain provides fewer than half the calories of fat.
Keep an eye on the fats you add when you're cooking or serving these types of foods because that's what <span style="color: var(--red)">increases the calorie content – for example, oil on chips, butter on bread and creamy sauces on pasta.</span></p>
<br>	
<p style="font-size: 18px;">It's recommended that you eat at least <span style="color: var(--red)">5 portions of a variety of fruit and veg every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.</span>
Getting your 5 A Day is easier than it sounds. Why not chop a banana over your breakfast cereal, or swap your usual mid-morning snack for a piece of fresh fruit?
A portion of fresh, canned or frozen fruit and vegetables is 80g. A portion of dried fruit (which should be kept to mealtimes) is 30g.
A 150ml glass of fruit juice, vegetable juice or smoothie also counts as 1 portion, but limit the amount you have to no more than 1 glass a day as these drinks are sugary and can damage your teeth.</p>	
<br>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">You need some fat in your diet, <span style="color: var(--red)">but it's important to pay attention to the amount and type of fat you're eating.</span>
<br>
There are 2 main types of fat:<span style="color: var(--red)"> saturated and unsaturated.</span> Too much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of developing heart disease.
On average, <span style="color: var(--red)">men should have no more than 30g of saturated fat a day.</span> On average, <span style="color: var(--red)">women should have no more than 20g of saturated fat a day.</span>
Children under the age of 11 should have less saturated fat than adults, <span style="color: var(--red)">but a low-fat diet is not suitable for children under 5.</span>
Saturated fat is found in many foods, such as:
<span style="color: var(--red)">fatty cuts of meat,
sausages,
butter,
hard cheese,
cream,
cakes,
biscuits,
lard and
pies.</span>
Try to eat less saturated fat and choose foods that contain unsaturated fats instead, such as vegetable oils and spreads, oily fish and avocados.
For a healthier choice, use a small amount of vegetable or olive oil, or reduced-fat spread instead of butter, lard or ghee.
When you're having meat, choose lean cuts and cut off any visible fat.
<span style="color: var(--red)">All types of fat are high in energy, so they should only be eaten in small amounts.</span></p>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">You need to drink plenty of fluids to stop you getting dehydrated. The government recommends drinking<span style="color: var(--red)"> 6 to 8 glasses every day.</span> This is in addition to the fluid you get from the food you eat. 
All non-alcoholic drinks count, but water, lower fat milk and lower sugar drinks, including tea and coffee, <span style="color: var(--red)">are healthier choices. </span>
Try to avoid sugary soft and fizzy drinks, as they're high in calories. They're also bad for your teeth. 
<span style="color: var(--red)">Even unsweetened fruit juice and smoothies are high in free sugar. </span>
Your combined total of drinks from fruit juice, vegetable juice and smoothies should not be more than 150ml a day, which is a small glass.
Remember to <span style="color: var(--red)">drink more fluids during hot weather or while exercising.</span></p>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">Some people skip breakfast because they think it'll help them lose weight.
But a healthy breakfast high in fibre and low in fat, sugar and salt can form part of a balanced diet, and can help you get the nutrients you need for good health.
<span style="color: var(--red)">A wholegrain lower sugar cereal with semi-skimmed milk and fruit sliced over the top is a tasty and healthier breakfast.</span></p>
